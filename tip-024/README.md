# 024 - Memory window #

Ever wondered what Memory windows in Visual Studio are for ðŸ’­? Wonder no more.

You can see raw memory ðŸ”¬ of objects in our application if you ever find that it's needed for you.

Memory window might scare you as it print hexadecimal address, buch of bytes that might not tell you a thing. Just type a name of a variable into the address field and it will be converted to an address and memory of that specific location will be shown displaying the data (i.e. string content).

See the attached animation below ðŸ‘‡

Would you had a need to use such low-level technique to see raw object bytes? If so I would like to read about it.
