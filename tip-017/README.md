# 017 - static lambda #

Lambdas is probably the fastest way to write anonymous function. But it's also an easy way to create it in a way that captures variable creating unnecessary allocations.

There's an easy way to detect those. Just add `static` keyword to your lambda to avoid accidental capture be detected by the compiler.

```csharp
// use the static âœ… keyword to prevent accidental capture of local variable or input parameter
data.Where(static x => x.CreatedBy == "admin");
```
