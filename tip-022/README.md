# 022 - Debugging abbilities #

Today an observation ðŸ¤¨.

I'm playing TOTK a lot (way, way too much ðŸŽ®) and I've observed that Link uses skills that share some similarities to those used during debugging.

Some of the Link's abilities are:


- ðŸ“ŒUltrahand - ability to manipulate objects,
- ðŸ“ŒRecall - allows you reverse the flow of time,
- ðŸ“ŒAscend - dive upwards and pass through solid objects to appear at the top.

Ultrahand in the debugging world is an obvious analogy to ability to manipulate objects properties that are being used in the program.

Recall would be a time-travel debugging, a technique to step back in time of the program execution and observing how some values have been generated.

The last one, Ascend could be linked with the ability to jump through stack traces when the program is stopped and appear in completely different place similar to Link.

For Link those along with Fuse are powerful abilities do you see those abilities are powerful in your debugging adventures? Do you use them?
