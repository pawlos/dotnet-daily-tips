# 043 - Trimming options #

Continuing topic about trimming the final binary üóú. Lets discuss what options we do have for that. Trimming without configuring options would be useful only in very limited number of cases.

- 1Ô∏è‚É£ First, we can set trim mode to be full or partial. In partial mode, we can specify which assemblies shall be trimmed and which should not be touched.
- 2Ô∏è‚É£ We can also specify additional assemblies (and it's dependencies) shall not be trimmed - `<TrimmerRootAssembly>`.

Some other options that can be used during the process:
- 1Ô∏è‚É£ `<TrimmerSingleWarn>false</TrimmerSingleWarn>` - shows more details warnings
- 2Ô∏è‚É£ `<TrimmerRemoveSymbols>true</TrimmerRemoveSymbols>` - cleans PDBs, including embedded ones. In both the app & dependencies.
- 3Ô∏è‚É£ `<DebuggerSupport>false</DebuggerSupport>` - removes support for the debugger, including symbols (2Ô∏è‚É£)
