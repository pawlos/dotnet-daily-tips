# 066 - Deconstruct #

Another duck-typing ü¶Ü post. A few days ago, I covered the GetAwaiter method that allows adding await functionality to any type. Today, another feature that relies on the same construct.

Deconstruction is a feature that allows extracting separate values out of a tuple. But what if we would like to deconstruct a type that is a bit more complex than a tuple? We can do it with the help of duck typing.

Deconstruction will work if the compiler detects a Deconstruct method that matches the call that we are trying to make. For example, let's try to deconstruct a Process. See the example below.

We start the process and wait for it to exit. In 1Ô∏è‚É£, we would like to use deconstruction to assign Pid & ExitCode to two variables. It won't work out of the box. But we can write an extension method 2Ô∏è‚É£ that the compiler would be able to use to perform the deconstruction.

```csharp
Process p = Process.Start("notepad.exe", "");
await p.WaitForExitAsync();

// 1Ô∏è‚É£ we would like to deconstruct process to pid and exit code
(int pid, int exitCode) = p;


public static class ProcessExtensions
{
    // 2Ô∏è‚É£ Provide extension method to allow Deconstruct
    public static void Deconstruct(this Process p, out int pid, out int exitCode)
    {
        pid = p.Id;
        exitCode = p.ExitCode;
    }
}
```
