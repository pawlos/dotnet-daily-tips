# 025 - Source generators #

Chillout topic for today 😎.

I'm still discovering the usefulness of Source generators but the community around it grows every day.

See 🔎 the awesome 💯 (yet not in the name) repository of C# Source Generators related projects - [C# Source generators](https://github.com/amis92/csharp-source-generators)

Do you use them in your projects? If so please share the examples 🙏.
