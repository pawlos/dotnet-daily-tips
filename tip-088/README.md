# 088 - `Console.Title` #

Being on the topic of the Console, apart from the `OutputEncoding` property, there are a bunch of other interesting properties and methods. One of them is `Title`.

It allows you to dynamically set the console window title. This unremarkable property can still be useful. I like how Benchmark.NET uses that to set the progress information about performance test execution. See the attached images ðŸ‘‡

Have you used that one?
