# 085 - Native library loading #

In the last two posts, we learned how we could use native libraries. When searching for a library to load, a few candidates are checked before it throws a DllNotFoundException.

If we specify in the code that we would like to load "test" 1Ô∏è‚É£, it will check a couple more: test.so, libtest.so, and test. We can see those in the exception output if the resolution fails 3Ô∏è‚É£. Only after all of those are not found will it throw an exception, causing our application to crash.

If needed, we can also attach our own resolver using NativeLibrary.SetDllImportResolver 2Ô∏è‚É£, which allows us to perform the resolution ourselves. One resolver per assembly can be registered with this method.

```csharp
namespace LibraryImportSamples;

public class NativeLibs
{
    // 1Ô∏è‚É£
    [LibraryImport("test")]
    internal static partial int getpid();
}

public static class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // 2Ô∏è‚É£
        NativeLibrary.SetDllImportResolver(Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly(), DllImportResolver);
        int pid = NativeLibs.getpid();
        Console.WriteLine($"Hello, World from {pid}");
    }

    private static IntPtr DllImportResolver(
        string libraryName,
        Assembly assembly,
        DllImportSearchPath? path)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Searching... {libraryName}");
        return IntPtr.Zero;
    }
}
// Output, in case we can't find the searched library will provide us with the information what was checked. 3Ô∏è‚É£ üëá
